# DCSS
Code to run:
Open the run.ipynb file in google colab and be careful to check the directoryï¼š%cd /content/DCSS/Codes

You can change the parameters and dataset of the train.py file:

AE: The autoencoder model.  
MNet: The mutual information estimation network.  
data_loader: The data loader for accessing the dataset.  
dataset_size: The total size of the dataset.  
batch_size: The batch size used during training. Default is 500.  
pretraining_epoch: The number of epochs for autoencoder pretraining. Default is 200.  
MaxIter1: The maximum number of iterations for the first phase of DCSS. Default is 200.  
MaxIter2: The maximum number of iterations for the second phase of DCSS. Default is 20.  
num_cluster: The number of clusters. Default is 10.  
m: The fuzziness parameter for cluster membership calculation. Default is 1.5.  
T1: The interval for updating cluster centers during the first phase. Default is 2.  
T2: The interval for updating cluster membership during the second phase. Default is 5.  
latent_size: The size of the latent space in the autoencoder. Default is 10.  
zeta: The threshold for determining when to update cluster centers during the second phase. Default is 0.8.  
gamma: The threshold for determining when to update cluster membership during the second phase. Default is 0.2.  
dataset_name: The name of the dataset. Default is 'MNIST'.  

For example, this run sets MaxIter1 to 150.
